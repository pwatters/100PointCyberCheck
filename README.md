100PointCyberCheck cyber assessment tool
Managing cyber risks is important for many reasons: aside from the direct losses incurred through cyber attacks, the Privacy Act 1988 in Australia and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes severe penalties on companies that are not compliant. The only way to understand your cyber risks is measuring and monitoring them over time. Created by a panel of world experts in cybersecurity, the 100 Point Cyber Check provides an easy, reliable way to diagnose cyber problems from a legal, regulatory, business operations and technical perspective.
